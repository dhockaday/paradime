ParaDime: A Framework for Parametric Dimensionality reduction
=============================================================

ParaDime is a modular framework for specifying and training parametric dimensionality reduction (DR) models. These models allow you to add new data points to existing low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. ParaDime DR models are constructed from simple building blocks (such as :ref:`relations` and :ref:`transforms`), so that experimentation with novel DR techniques becomes easy.
